    <h2>
        Team name: 
    </h2> 

    <p>Vo Hieu Thuan - s3778600.Thuan is our leader and gave us this idea about a single-player role-playing game with turn-based tactics. He is currently a robotics major and has done multiple team projects throughout the course, from coding simple stuff to making operating systems. 
        His hobbies are reading news about technology and finding out how things work and the mechanism behind it. He is interested in robotics, therefore, embedded systems and artificial intelligence to advance robot automation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hoang Nguyen - s3929351. Hoang currently studies software engineering and is our team member. His hobbies are finding out how things work like Thuan and making things himself. Since he tends to electronics, his interests are embedded systems and cloud-based systems. He used to build PC by buying separate components and troubleshooting PC problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nguyen Chau - s3975133. Chau currently studies information technology, and his hobby is reading about new PC technology and products. He is interested in big data and the way of sorting out data efficiently. He has built his PC by himself and customized it with led to make it more beautiful. Also, he has learned some simple coding with the online tutorial.
    </p>

During his free time, he also goes online and learns simple stuff about AI and coding.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Group processes
    </h2>

    <p>
        Our team worked together efficiently throughout the group assignment. We communicated through messenger and met each other face-to-face after the tutorial session. Right from the start, we quickly chose a topic to make within three days and made a cloud document so that every team member could jump in to write their part and see others people's progress. We tend to finish the work as soon as possible minimum three days before the deadline, so that we can have time to recheck the work.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Career Plans
    </h2>

    <p>
        Thuan's ideal job is to work in a company that makes automated robots for factories or a company related to designed robotics. Hoang's ideal job is to be an embedded system coder or a firmware coder. Chau's perfect job is to be an app or website developer. Tan's right job can be an AI programmer or something related to making AI on the machine. We all have a common element in knowing the basics of computer work and coding an application that runs on the computer. However, we still have to differentiate each position from the others. Thuan is more understanding of the mechanical work of objects or physic since he is in robotics major. Hoang deeply understands how the logic of computer components works with each other. Chau will better understand how to design user-friendly software. Tan will have a better understanding of computing mathematics since math will be used a lot in AI designing.

    <p>According to the dedication chart, the left portion is significantly greater than the right portion. Because we set up a shared GitHub account for two designers, it will be impossible to see each person's contribution, and on the right is Hoang's account linked to the project when the other person is working on the shared account so that both can work in parallel.

        Project Description
    </h1>

    <h2>
        <i>Overview</i>
    </h2>

    <h3>
        Topic
    </h3>

    <p>
        Our project focuses mostly on developing a game that can run smoothly on a Bare-metal OS system, which needs a Command Line Interpreter (CLI) to display images, video, and word Font on screen by applying the framebuffer with various binary header files. As for the game part, after a long discussion with each member, we had come to a decision that we would change the game type, not the game with turn-based tactics like before, but instead, an open-world role-playing game, which is inspired by The Legend of Zelda game series. We decided the name of the game is “The Enigmatic Journey”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game will give the player full control of the character, you can choose what to do during the game's vitality as moving around and battling the creatures they encounter, collecting material to craft weapons and enhance your gears, learning different abilities, and also healing your character by eating food, which makes the game more flexible to play. The main character has two parameters: the blue bar is the MP for the character to cast the spell and the red bar indicates the player's HP. 
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>
        Motivation
    </h3>

    <p>
        The project was motivated by the Zelda game and also by one of the most well-known games in the world now a day is Genshin Impact. We are fascinated by the freedom the game gives us, the player, to do everything we want, we can follow the main storylines and learn about the plot of the game, or we can explore the open world where a lot of interesting waiting for us to discover, finding out the story of the NPCs, collecting materials, fighting difference enemies, … 
    </p>

    <p>
        The current game trend now a day focuses on building a mysterious open world where players will never feel bored playing, the players will see that they are actually the main character in the game, and embark on an adventure to solve the world's mysteries with their companions. So our game will have a lot of elements that will satisfy the demands of gamers like an amazing storyline, a variety of enemies and NPCs, various abilities and weapons waiting for players to achieve, and a world with different environments to make the game more realistic. We see that our project has the potential to make a big splash in the domestic game industry in the near future.

    <h3>
        Landscape
    </h3>

    <p>
        Due to our game being based on other famous games so the competition will be extremely fierce because Zelda is the game of the year in 2017 and Genshin Impact was the Best Mobile Game in 2021. But unlike those games, which are animated in 3d, our game is created based on pixel type that requires less work on the graphics array and it makes the game run smoothly because it does not need a strong system to operate compared to the other two games. Moreover, pixel art is very attractive to a lot of gamers because it reminds them of the games of the last decades like Mario, Minecraft, … which encourages them to play our game more.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Detailed Description
    </h3>

    <h3>
        Aims
    </h3>

    <p>
        Our project focuses mostly on building a different version of the Zelda game in pixel type that makes a game quite similar but distinct from the game it is based on. The main plot is around a girl who was born in a quiet tiny town. One day, though, tragedy struck when a large number of monsters attacked and destroyed the town for no apparent cause. There was no one left to protect this tiny, isolated community because the men who rose to defend their hometown were severely injured in that onslaught. Fearing that the monsters would come back again, the girl set out to enter the forbidden area of ​​the village, learning about the reason behind the mysterious attack. 
    </p>

    <p>
        There are some details we want to work on like putting some random chest to make the game easier and evoke the player's exploration, adding sidequests to increase the protagonist’s level before going into a boss fight, … However, due to a lack of time and staff, we should focus on the most crucial component, which is character and monster design. Before going on to the subsequent parts, we wanted to concentrate on animating the protagonists' actions and attacks, as well as the monsters' movements.Combat has always been key in RPG games so it can attract many people who want to experience it. 
    </p>

    <p> After achieving the aforementioned objective, we also want to expand the map in order to enrich the game universe. We're sharing special locales like deserts, oceans,... with a diversity of unique species and scenery because a game with only one scenario will be uninteresting and make players lose interest. Appearing there contributes to the game's increased exploration and enjoyment.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Plans and Progress
    </h3>

    <h3>
        Screen
    </h3>

    <p>
        In order to create a simple game using command lines, we choose to use the Pycharm application, which contains a very helpful utility called the pygame module. The first step in programming is to design a screen to display the visuals that will appear on the screen. This is a very simple but essential component of every game. We test the screen 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall, and we added the game's caption to the bottom left corner.
    </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            
        <img src="Picture3.png" alt="Image3">
            <br>  Screen appears
            
        </p>

    <h3>
        Image
    </h3>

    <p>
        Now we testing if we can display anything on the screen surface. we add some code with will display a rectangle size of 200 and 400 with the former being the width and the latter being the height. we set the position of the rectangle as 10x50 and fill it colour with red.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="Picture4.png" alt="Image4">
            <br> A rectangle has been created 
        
    </p>

    <p>
        The image displays perfectly on the screen surface.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we create a simple animation by moving the rectangle with buttons. Each time we click the button, we'll program the image to move 10 frames in the direction we want. The old position of the image won't be erased when we move the new one, so we'll need to repeat this step to be able to overlap the old position so that it appears as though we're moving the image. To do this, we'll need to create a surface proportional to the scale of the screen before moving the image.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="Picture5.png" alt="Image5">
            <br> The rectangle had moved to the right
    </p>

    <p>
        The graphic shows a picture that has been altered before and after when we press the right button. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The same idea of presenting a picture was used for the video, but we added more images with a delay function in between. After a short delay, it will trigger the screen to refresh pictures in order to display videos (multiple frames display with delay in a short amount of time will mislead the user that the image is moving on its own).
    </p>

    <h3>
        Map and Character
    </h3>

    <p>
        After finishing the foundational steps, we must upload the game's image from the folder to the desktop. There will be a lot of code, therefore we must divide it up into various files to make it easier to comprehend and remedy errors in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        The same technique from the image displayed on the screen above is implemented in the game to create an individual map. We must first work with the map so that we can layer the characters on top of it and loop them to give them motion. As there will be many photos to upload to the screen, such as trees, barriers, boulders, etc., we need to organize them into a dictionary function so that they load neatly and are simple to locate.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="Picture6.png" alt="Image6">
        </p>
    
    <p>
        For the player file, we not only loaded the images of the character like he moved right, left, up, down, idle image but also had to program the buttons so that when we press the button, we move the image of the character in the direction we click as shown above.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="Picture7.png" alt="Image7">
        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After everything is done, we import the map and player files into the main so that it reads the code and executes.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="Picture8.png" alt="Image8">
            <br> Trees, flowers, and character can be seen on the map
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="Picture9.png" alt="Image9">
        <img src="Picture10.png" alt="Image10">
            <br>The difference in an animation of the character
    </p>

    <p>
        The map has been effectively formed, as seen by the trees and flowers that give it life. Our character has also appeared on the map, when moving, the character is also formed with various images, such as the image on the left, the image above, and the default image.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Camera and collision 
    </h3>

    <p>
        Following the completion of the game's character and map. We came to understand that a character can only move within the confines of the screen; if they attempt to travel outside of it, they will vanish off the screen. We struggled to program the character to move across the entire map and were forced to learn more about the setup. We spent a lot of time researching the issue before we finally came up with a solution, which was to program a camera that would put the character in the center and follow the character wherever it went. This would allow us to move freely around the map without being concerned about our character vanishing.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="Picture11.png" alt="Image11">
        
    </p>

    <p>
        However, a new issue arises since our character is obscured by images of objects like trees and obstacles, and when we approach the edge of the map, we will exit into the dark, leading to a significant error in the game. Therefore, we must configure the collision command line so that whenever we approach an object's edge or the edge of the map, we are forbidden from moving any farther.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="Picture12.png" alt="Image12">

    </p>
    <p>
        With this, the game is approximately halfway finished, the character may now be moved anywhere without the graphics overlapping.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Future features
    </h3>

    <p>
        We weren't able to finish the entire game because of a lack of time and help. When the prerequisites are reached, we will eventually add further features like weapons, spells, and different enemy types that will charge at us when we approach, sounds, music, ….
    </p>

        Example:

    <h3>
        Roles
    </h3>

    <p>
        To finish this project, each member of our team is responsible for a certain task.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thuan is a game developer for operating systems, whose responsibility it is to ensure that our game runs on operating systems without delays and that gamers have the greatest possible experience. This is crucial since lag occurs frequently in games when many graphics are loading at once, making it crucial to identify and correct it. Ascertain whether users hold high regard for your game.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kit will create the characters, backdrops, and other visual elements as a graphic designer. This is a difficult undertaking because creating a realistic and gorgeous game takes a lot of photos, ambient backgrounds, and several character animations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The people in charge of game programming will be Chau and Hoang. This may be said to need the greatest work, requiring two persons to set up the screen, the character-moving buttons, download the designer's graphics, and modify the enemy's assault when the character is nearby,...  As can be seen, this task is rather extensive, therefore after Thuan and Kit have finished, they might need to assist us in creating this game's system.

    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>
        To be able to program our game, we need the PyCharm tool. With the aid of the program Pycharm, we can write code, design gaming screens, and store them as files that are easy to open and arrange. Hoang and Chau have used it many times in their previous programming class, they say it is a great application because it has many modules that help with programming, application creation or game making.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we employ a program called Tiled, which turns pixelated images into lines of numbers. Pycharm occasionally needs to use these lines of numbers to pinpoint an image's location. When designing the map and placing the characters, Pycharm will rely on Tiled's file to locate the image where it is and place it there, making the map more vivid and rich. Kit is a Tiled user because he's our graphic designer. It is difficult to understand all the features of this application at first because it is necessary to find the right image and put it in the aspect ratio of the application to export. But after a few weeks of research, he was also able to create a perfect map with randomly arranged landscapes that can be exported to a file containing the numbers of the image locations.
    </p>

    <p>Example of Tiled:</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="Picture18.png" alt="Image18">
            <br> This image has an id of 0 and an empty image has an id of -1

    <br>
        <img src="Picture19.png" alt="Image19">
        <br>The image has been exported to a file containing the number
    </p>
    
    <p>Raspberry pi: </p>
    <p>The Raspberry pi is a good testing tool for this project because it  provides low-cost, high-performance computers that people use to learn, and solve problems. It develops free resources to help people learn about computing and making things with computers and also trains educators who can guide other people to learn.
    </p>
    <p>When compared to Arduino and other boards, we can  see that it has a quicker processor. The Raspberry Pi 3B model comes with a 1.6 GHz processor, whereas the Arduino comes with a controller. This would make a great testing tool for our game if the main objective is to run smoothly on a non gaming pc.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>
        The importance of testing cannot ever be overstated in programming. We must frequently test to ensure that everything is still operating as intended because a single error could cause the software to crash. When a section of the plan is finished, we often test it to see if it functions or not, checking things like the screen to see if the character picture displays or not, whether the character moves how we want it to, and so on. We occasionally run into issues with new parts because when they operate, they will often cause the old part to malfunction and prevent the program from starting. In these cases, we must return to the earlier parts and make the necessary adjustments to enable them to operate concurrently with the new part. So testing is crucial if we want to be able to correct errors that we missed while coding and improve the game.
    </p>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <h4><ins>Missing eMMC Internal Storage </ins></h4>
    <p>Since the Raspberry pi doesn't have any internal storage it requires a micro SD card to work as an internal storage. We all know that SD cards are not that fast. It lacks performance, so this increases boot time of the board and read/write speed of the Raspberry pi. This could cause some minor lagging while playing the game with the background music because multiple cores are needed to perform all those tasks at the same time.
     </p>
    
    <p>Optimizing the code will be a key solution since this is one of the downsides of the Raspberry pi. Moreover, using more cores of the board may also solve the issue.
     </p>
    
    <h4><ins>Losing Data </ins></h4>
    <p>Since every data is compiled into a micro SD card, a chance of losing it would happen if not careful. In order to do testing with the Raspberry Pi board, the micro SD will be removed  from the board many times. Therefore, during those processes, a tiny card can be easily broken or lost.
    </p>
    <p>The main solution for the problem is more mindful with usage of the micro SD card. Saving data on the usual basis will also help with dealing with the problem.
    </p>
    
    <h4><ins>Overheating </ins></h4>
    <p>As the board doesn't come with any heat-sinks pre-applied or any cooling fan and the Raspberry pi 4 comes with a powerful processor and multiple features, the heat dissipation is one of the main problems for any circuitry. If you use it for continuous 6-7 hours without proper ventilation, it might damage the circuit inside the board.
    </p>
    <p>A small DC cooling fan can be attached to the board to increase the heat dissipation process. </p>
    
    
    <h4><ins>Team members do not finish the allocated tasks on designated time </ins></h4>
    <p> Some team members may be busy with their problems which can lead to being unable to complete the tasks. It could be their own personal issues or they have another upcoming assignment in other courses. This could be a hindrance to the process of the whole group and it may lead to late submission of the project.
    </p>
    <p>The solution is to reach out to the rest of the group as soon as possible. The sooner other people know the problem, the better the group is able to handle the problem.
    </p>
    
    
    <h4><ins>Tasks Allocation </ins></h4>
    <p>It is undeniable that every team member has different strengths and weaknesses. If an allocated task is not suitable for that person, it will cost more time and effort to complete a single task. It is going to affect that person's schedule negatively which could lead to other potential problems. Furthermore, each member's contribution to the project would be more complicated since they have to do a difficult task based on their perspective.
    </p>
    <p>t is important to know your team member abilities and strengths. Weekly meetings should be conducted in order to monitor the performance and progress of each team member for a better task allocation.
    </p>
    
    
    <h4><ins>Absence of a team member</ins></h4>
    <p>It is hard to predict what is going to happen tomorrow.  A team member could be absent during the project development project due to some unforeseen and unfortunate reasons. This will slow down the development process and create more problems for the rest of the group.
    </p>
    <p>In a worse case scenario, the project will be halted and the situation will be reported to supervisors for a better solution if the group does not have enough members to reasonably finish the project. If this is not the case, the rest of the team needs to have an emergency meeting to address the problem and allocate the unfinished tasks.
     </p>
    
    
    <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
    <p>Since our team only has four people, arranging a specific meeting time is relatively easy. We will meet face-to-face after the tutorial session to have a quick discussion about the plan for the project. Our other form of communication is through Messenger – Facebook, we share each other's accounts and create a group chat. If some of us need to visualize the ideas, we will meet through Teams. In case of someone does not respond, we will send a direct e-mail through Outlook for that person to notice. If that person still has not responded to us, we will wait until the tutorial lesson to meet face-to-face and find out what made us lose contact with him. Usually, we will have a voice meeting through Messenger at night on Thursday to further discussion on that week's subject and about the progress of each part. Moreover, we can schedule more appointments on Thursday if one session is not enough to solve the problem.

    <h1 style="color:blue;">Project outcomes/Product Prototype</h1>
    <p>When the game has been implemented in the Raspberry pi, the game has its own functionality. 
The game functionality contains the ability to control characters around the different maps. The player can battle creature, collect materials, and craft tools. It also includes features likes skill system, HP and man system and flexible story line for the player to enjoy. 
 </p>
    <p>If the game runs smoothly on a Raspberry pi, it will solve the high processing power problems that an open world games usually have. Since most open world games usually have to run on an expensive gaming pc, our game design focus on low processing power for non-gaming pc and enjoyable for the player.
 </p>
    <p>The game is still in the early stages of the development since coding and programming a game took an insane amount of times. With only about 2 months of project development, it is almost impossible to finish the project. Currently, you can only move around a map with different biomes. All important game mechanics like collision, terrains and characters system have implemented into the game. Some of the known bugs are delay times between pressing buttons and character moving and the character sprites may glitch into the terrains.
    </p>
    <p>In the future, our team will program the rest of the game since it has not finished yet. New story lines and characters could be added to keep the game alive and interesting. Some codes may be optimized for further improve the game smooth performance. If this game gets more popular in the future, mobile version of the game could be implemented.

    <p><b><ins>Vo Hieu Thuan - s3778600</ins></b></p>
    <p>As the leader of the group, it is my responsibility to create plans and meeting for the group to develop the project efficiently. Although it is unfortunate that one of the members dropped this course halfway, the rest of the members still divide the tasks equally. In my own perspective, the other two remained members are quite talented and experienced in doing the own tasks. With suitable tasks allocation, it is more efficient and less stressful in the process of developing the project.
 </p>
    
    
    <p><b><ins>Hoang Nguyen - s3929351</ins></b></p>
    <p>Although this project can be quite difficult for me, it was a good learning experience for when working in a group and developing a game. Without the fourth members of the teams, it is a significant increase in workload for each member of the group. Luckily, with all members of team is experienced person, the project can still be finished without any major incidents.
 </p>
    
    
    <p><b><ins>Nguyen Chau - s3975133</ins></b></p>
    <p>With the help of the rest of the team, I can focus on developing the game better than working on it alone. This game has been by personal project for quite a while but unable to finish it due to the huge time investment in developing. By combine this project to our group project, I am quite grateful to the other members with developing this game. It has been the one best learning experience for me to work in this group.
